        <p><span>Now here is something really interesting (to me)</span>, something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa<span>: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime.</span> That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.</p>
        <p><span>When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!”</span> he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that <span>allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. </span></p>
