      <p class="box-1">In the beginning was the Word. <br> Western civilization rests upon those words. <br>And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive <br>love before some kind of act. </p>
      <p class="box-2">I believe the poem is an act of the mind. <br> I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.</p>
