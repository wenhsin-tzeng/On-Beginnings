    <div class="box-1">
      <div class="box-1-1">
        <p>I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: <br>The End. <br>I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box-1-2">The End.</div>
      <div class="box-1-3">
        <p>It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, <br>I read them, even if only silently, <br>with a deep sense of feeling: <br>both the feeling of being replete, <br>a feeling of satisfaction, <br>and the feeling of loss, <br>the sadness of having finished the book.</p>
        <p><br>I have never, in my life, <br>read a poem that ended with the words <br>The End.</p>
        <p><br>Why is that, I wonder.<br>I think perhaps the brevity of poems<br>compared to novels makes one feel that<br>there has been no great sustention of energy,<br>no marathon worthy of pulling tape<br>across the finish line.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="box-2">
      <p>And then I found a poem of mine<br>that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, <br>and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, <br>beautifully apart from the rest of the text,<br>were the words The End.<br>And I realized children very often denote the end <br>because it is indeed a great achievement for them<br>to have written anything,<br>and they are completely unaware<br>of the number of stories and poems<br>that have already been written;<br>they know some, of course, but have not yet found out <br>the extent to which they are not<br>the only persons residing on the planet.<br>And so they sign their poems and stories like kings.<br>Which is a wonderful thing. </p>
